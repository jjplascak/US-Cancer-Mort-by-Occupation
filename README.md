# US-Cancer-Mort-by-Occupation
Details in conjunction with the pre-print study, "US cancer mortality rates by detailed occupation among working-age adults, 2020-2023." Cancer deaths (International Classification of Disease â€“ 10 codes C00-C99, n=450,453) from 2020 to 2023 among adults aged 20-64 years were obtained from the US National Center for Health Statistics, and categorized by sex and occupation, using 452 detailed US Census 2010 occupation codes and 23 major occupation groups. Population estimates by sex, age, year, and occupation were from the annual American Community Survey and Decennial Censuses. Average annual, age-adjusted cancer mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by sex, occupation, and 22 main cancer sites were tabulated and displayed in forest plots.
